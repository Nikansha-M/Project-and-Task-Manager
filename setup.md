### Set Up Directory and GitLab Project

1. Cd into your projects directory
1. Fork and Clone the starter project to your Projects Directory:
    1. Since I already have a PROJECT ALPHA repository in GitLab, additional steps I need to  follow:
        1. Create a blank GitLab project, set visibility to Public, initialize **without** the README file
        1. While in your projects directory:  git clone https://gitlab.com/sjp19-public-resources/sjp-2022-april/project-alpha-apr.git(SJP)
        1. Cd PROJECT ALPHA
        1. Git remote rm origin (to remove the origin branch)
        1. Git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/Nikansha.M/project-alpha-june.git (clone the blank PROJECT ALPHA I created in my GitLab repository - the one without the readme file
        1. Git remote -v
            1. This will list out:
                1. origin  https://gitlab.com/Nikansha.M/project-alpha-june.git (fetch)
                1. origin  https://gitlab.com/Nikansha.M/project-alpha-june.git (push)
        1. git push --set-upstream origin main (this is a one-time command youâ€™ll use)
1. Refresh GitLab page, you should now see the same commits that were made to the original SJP project on GitLab

TO PUSH YOUR PROJECT UP TO GITLAB, USE **git push origin main**
